    "reasoning": "California's Viability Index sits at 34/100 — firmly in 'Strongly Consider Leaving' territory — driven by a confluence of structural fiscal problems, extreme housing unaffordability, and persistent net domestic outmigration. The state carries a projected $68 billion budget shortfall for FY2025-26, compounding unfunded pension liabilities at CalPERS (~72% funded ratio, implying a $300B+ gap). On affordability, California's median home price of approximately $800,000 is nearly double the national median of $420,000, while the state's 13.3% top marginal income tax rate remains the highest in the nation. Net domestic outmigration continues at roughly 180,000–200,000 persons per year, with IRS migration data confirming that outbound filers skew toward higher-income brackets — a critical Sowell-style incentive signal: those with the most economic mobility are voting with their feet. Unemployment remains elevated at ~5.3% vs. the U.S. average of ~4.1%, a 1.2-point gap that has persisted for years. Homelessness stands at roughly 180,000 (approximately 28% of the national total despite California holding only 12% of the U.S. population). Policy risk remains high with no structural reforms to Prop 13 commercial exemptions, CEQA litigation exposure, or AB5 contractor restrictions. The sole positive pressure: California's GDP growth remains above the national average in nominal terms, driven by the tech sector, preventing a deeper score decline.",
