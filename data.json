Fiscal sustainability (sub-score 45/100, weight 25%) reflects structural budget imbalances and pension underfunding that compound annually.

Economic performance (sub-score 64/100) is partly buoyed by tech-sector GDP growth, but unemployment remains 1.2 points above the national rate. Quality of life and safety (sub-score 41/100) is weighed down by homelessness rates roughly 2.4\u00d7 the national per-capita average.

Net domestic outmigration continues at roughly 180,000\u2013200,000 persons per year, with IRS migration data confirming that outbound filers skew toward higher-income brackets \u2014 a critical Sowell-style incentive signal: those with the most economic mobility are voting with their feet. Unemployment remains elevated at ~5.3% vs. the U.S. average of ~4.1%, a 1.2-point gap that has persisted for years. Homelessness stands at roughly 180,000 (approximately 28% of the national total despite California holding only 12% of the U.S. population).
